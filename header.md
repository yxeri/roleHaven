You will need a JSON Web Token to use most of the API.Start by creating a user (if you don't already have one) and
authenticate using that user to receive a token.
The token should be set in Authorization in the header.
Some parameters have marked with Url, Query or Body. This indicates where the parameter should be set.
/api/users/urlParameter/?queryParameter=value.
